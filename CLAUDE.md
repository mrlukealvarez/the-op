## ENTITY IDENTITY

THE OP LLC is a community coffee shop and campus merchandise counter on the Grow Campus in Custer, South Dakota. Think Wild Spruce Market — a charming stop where tourists grab coffee, local beer, snacks, and souvenirs on their way to Custer State Park.

**What THE OP IS:**

- Coffee shop (espresso, drip, cold brew, local beer/cider on tap)
- Merch counter (BHC branded apparel, local artisan goods, tourist souvenirs)
- Drive-through window for grab-and-go tourists
- Employee perks profit center (food/beverage/merch as BHC employee benefits)
- GrowWise POS live demo for investor campus tours

**What THE OP is NOT:**

- NOT a cannabis cafe or Amsterdam-style anything
- NOT an event venue (that's THE CULT Events LLC)
- NOT a coworking space (that's Grow Campus)
- NOT a full restaurant (counter service only, no chef, no sit-down dining)

## KEY STRATEGIC ELEMENTS

- **Zero rent:** Owned Grow Campus real estate — 15-20% margin advantage
- **14.9M tourists:** SD annual visitors, 2M+ past campus via Custer State Park
- **Employee perks model:** F&B + merch as BHC employee benefits — fully deductible
- **$2/transaction charitable floor:** $1.50 Seed Foundation + $0.50 BHC per transaction
- **Charity QR on coffee sleeve:** Every cup has a QR code linking to Seed Foundation + BHC donation pages — passive fundraising with every coffee sold
- **POS round-up donation:** GrowWise POS prompts "Round up to the nearest dollar for BHC?" at checkout — classic charity round-up model, also demos GrowWise charitable integration for visiting investors
- **Drive-through:** Captures grab-and-go tourist traffic
- **Everything Is Content:** Outpost Media produces zero-CAC marketing content
- **GrowWise live demo:** POS runs on GrowWise — investors see platform while ordering coffee
- **Rotating local roster:** Coffee roasters and craft beer/cider rotate constantly — no two visits the same. Every VC, celebrity, or tourist gets a different experience. Cycle through Black Hills roasters (Black Hills Coffee, etc.) and local breweries (Miner, Sawyer, etc.) so the menu is always fresh and uniquely local.

## FLYWHEEL

### RECEIVES FROM ECOSYSTEM

- **Foot traffic from Grow Campus workers:** 51 employees Y1 → 175 Y5 = regular morning coffee customers
- **Settle the West relocators:** 50 → 400 relocations = new regular customers (remote workers grab coffee daily)
- **Tourists:** 14.9M annual SD visitors, 2M+ past campus via Custer State Park
- **Investors:** Every BHC investor tour includes casual coffee stop at THE OP

### PROVIDES TO ECOSYSTEM

- **GrowWise POS live demo:** Zero marketing cost — investors see platform running in real-world coffee shop environment
- **Community anchor:** Friendly local spot where construction workers and software developers grab morning coffee (breaks down "us vs. them")
- **Content for Outpost Media:** Every latte art photo, every supplier story, every customer feature becomes evergreen content for High Culture channel
- **Merch revenue:** BHC-branded apparel sales = brand awareness + revenue (tourists wearing BHC shirts across the country)

**Everything Is Content Model:** Outpost Media produces ~200 episodes/year across 9 channels. Even 3% featuring THE OP = 6 free content pieces annually. Barista latte art videos (YouTube), customer coffee stories (podcast), local supplier spotlights (blog) — zero CAC, content compounds forever.

**Example Capital Flow (Year 5):**

1. Settle the West relocates 400 workers to Black Hills
2. 25% become regular THE OP customers (100 people)
3. 100 regulars × $30 avg spend/week × 52 weeks = $156,000/year from Settle the West alone
4. THE OP films relocator first-coffee stories → Outpost Media "High Culture" channel → More relocators discover THE OP
5. **Flywheel:** Relocators → Customers → Content → More Relocators
