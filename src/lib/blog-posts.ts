    content: `South Dakota draws 14.9 million visitors a year. Two million of them drive right past the Grow Campus on the way to Custer State Park. THE OP is the coffee stop they did not know they needed.

The name "THE OP" is short for "outpost." It reflects our location — a frontier town at the edge of one of America's most remarkable landscapes — and our identity within the Black Hills Consortium ecosystem. THE OP is the living room of the Grow Campus. The place where GrowWise engineers take their afternoon coffee break. Where Seed Academy students decompress after class. Where Outpost Media producers plan their next episode. Where tourists wander in, curious about the campus, and leave wondering how to move here.

Think Wild Spruce Market in Custer — a charming stop where tourists grab coffee, browse local goods, and take a breath before continuing their journey. That is THE OP, but on a tech campus surrounded by pines with views of the Black Hills.

The design is warm and inviting. Natural wood and local materials. Large windows that frame views of the surrounding pines. An outdoor patio that becomes the center of activity from May through October, with mountain views that make every cup of coffee better. A layout that creates intimate corners for quiet conversation alongside communal tables for group energy.

What makes THE OP special is the rotating local roster. We cycle through Black Hills coffee roasters, local craft breweries, and regional cider makers so the menu is never the same twice. A VC visiting in March might get Miner Brewing on tap. A tourist in July might discover Sawyer Brewing. A celebrity passing through in October gets something entirely different. Every visit is unique because the Black Hills have that much to offer.

The menu reflects our values. Locally roasted coffee from Black Hills roasters. Pastries from Custer and Hot Springs bakeries. Local beer and cider on tap from breweries within 50 miles. Light sandwiches and snacks for the road. And a merch counter stocked with BHC-branded apparel, local artisan goods, and Black Hills souvenirs.

Every coffee sleeve has a QR code linking to our community charities. Every POS transaction asks if you want to round up to the nearest dollar for BHC. Simple, transparent, and genuine.

Year one revenue target: $380,000. But THE OP's value to the Black Hills Consortium extends far beyond its own revenue. It is the connective tissue of the campus. The place where ideas happen, relationships form, and the culture of the entire ecosystem takes shape.

The Black Hills have always been a place people pass through. THE OP is where they stop — and sometimes where they decide to stay.`,

    content: `In 1989, sociologist Ray Oldenburg published "The Great Good Place," a book about the spaces that exist between home and work. Barbershops, pubs, cafes, bookstores — places where people gather informally, where social hierarchies flatten, and where community actually happens. He called them "third places."

Thirty-seven years later, the concept matters more than ever. And small towns need it most.

The data on American social isolation is alarming. The U.S. Surgeon General declared loneliness a public health epidemic in 2023. The average American has fewer close friends than at any point in measured history. Church attendance, civic club membership, and neighborhood socializing have all declined precipitously since the 1990s.

Remote work accelerated the problem. When your office was your social life — and millions of Americans admit it was — losing the commute meant losing your primary source of human connection. Remote workers report higher rates of loneliness, depression, and professional isolation than their in-office counterparts.

Small towns should be the antidote. Tight-knit communities, short distances, neighbors who wave from their driveways. But the reality is that many small towns have lost their third places. The diner closed. The barbershop went out of business. The main street hollowed out as Walmart and Amazon redirected spending.

THE OP exists to restore the third place to a small town. Not as nostalgia, but as infrastructure. Intentional, designed infrastructure for human connection.

What makes a great third place? Oldenburg identified several characteristics. It is neutral ground — no one plays host, and everyone feels welcome. It is a leveler — your job title, your income, and your social status do not matter when you are standing in line for a latte. Conversation is the main activity. The mood is playful. It has regulars who create a sense of familiarity and belonging.

THE OP is designed around these principles. The pricing is intentionally accessible — a great cup of coffee should not cost eight dollars. The layout creates both group and individual spaces. The events calendar ensures there is always a reason to come back. And the staff is trained not just in coffee preparation but in hospitality — the art of making people feel like they belong.

Custer has 2,100 residents. During tourist season, the population swells as visitors pour through on their way to Custer State Park and Mount Rushmore. THE OP serves both audiences. For locals, it is the living room of the town. For visitors, it is the first authentic taste of Black Hills community. Many visitors have told us the same thing: "We came for the park. We are thinking about staying because of the town."

That is the power of a third place. It does not just serve coffee. It creates the conditions for community to form. And in a country where community is fraying at the edges, that is worth more than any business model can capture.

Every town needs a third place. Custer's is THE OP.`,

    content: `Coffee from Rapid City. Pastries from Custer. Beer from Hill City. Every dollar spent at THE OP stays in the Black Hills — and tourists go home telling that story.

When we designed THE OP, we made one rule: source everything from within 50 miles. Not because it is trendy, but because it makes economic and moral sense. When you buy a latte at THE OP, the coffee was roasted by Black Hills Coffee in Rapid City. The pastry came from a bakery in Custer. The beer on tap was brewed in Hill City. The honey in your tea was harvested in Hot Springs. The pottery on the shelf was thrown by an artist 20 miles down the road.

The menu board tells the whole story. Every item lists its source: "Coffee: Black Hills Coffee, Rapid City. Roasted Tuesday." "Pastries: Anderson Bakery, Custer. Delivered this morning." "Beer: Miner Brewing, Hill City." Customers see exactly where their money goes. And they love it.

This is not a gimmick. It is a business strategy with compounding returns.

First, local sourcing builds supplier relationships that become partnerships. When Black Hills Coffee saw their name on our menu board, they posted it on Facebook. Their customers started visiting THE OP just to see where their coffee goes. We invited the roaster for a podcast interview with Outpost Media. Now we cross-promote each other. They send customers to us, we send customers to them. That is local-first economics.

Second, local sourcing creates a tourist story. People do not go home and tell their friends about the Starbucks they visited on vacation. They talk about the local coffee shop where everything came from within 50 miles, where the barista recommended a hiking trail, and where they bought a handmade mug from a local potter. THE OP gives tourists a story worth telling.

Third, local sourcing means rotating variety. We cycle through Black Hills roasters and local breweries so the menu changes regularly. A visitor in June might get a different coffee and different beer than a visitor in September. This creates a reason to come back and a sense of discovery with every visit.

The financial model is straightforward. Year one revenue target: $380,000 across coffee, food, beer, and merchandise. Food and beverage represent 79% of revenue. Merchandise — BHC-branded apparel, local artisan goods, and tourist souvenirs — represents 21%. By Year 5, revenue scales to $1.9 million as the brand establishes itself, online merch sales launch, and the Settle the West program brings hundreds of new regular customers to the area.

The location helps enormously. THE OP sits on the Grow Campus, which is owned by Pass Creek Holdings. That means zero market-rate rent — a 15-20% margin advantage over any comparable cafe paying $80,000+ per year in lease costs. It is the lowest-risk entity in the entire Black Hills Consortium portfolio.

Every cup of coffee tells a story. Every beer on tap has a local brewer behind it. Every item on the merch shelf was made by someone who lives in the Hills. That is what local-first means at THE OP — and it is why tourists keep coming back.`,
